            A rainbow in the sky: <br>
         So was it when my life began; <br> 
         So is it now I am a man; <br>
         So be it when I shall grow old, <br> 
            Or let me die! <br>
         The Child is father of the Man; <br>
         And I could wish my days to be <br>
         Bound each to each by natural piety.</p>
